<h2 align=center>Building WinForm Applications that <br/></i>Have <i>Unlimited Docking Abilities</i> and <i>Support Web Content Ecology</i></h2>

<h3>

We borrowed two aerospace concepts from wikipedia: [_Docking_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_and_berthing_of_spacecraft#Docking) and [_Berthing_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_and_berthing_of_spacecraft#Berthing). When we think that each WinForm object is a huge spacecraft, an interesting phenomenon is that while the WinForm object has the unlimited docking ability with other types of WinForm objects, it also has unlimited berthing ability.</h3>
